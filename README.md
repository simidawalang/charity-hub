#Charity Hub

CharityHub uses a smart contract to ensure that charities reach where they're supposed to and also keeps a record of donations. It is built with **NextJS** and its smart contract written in **Solidity**. 

To get started:
- Pls ensure you have the **[MetaMask-extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)** installed on your browser. After installation, set up one or two accounts on the **Rinkeby test network**.
- run `yarn install` in the root directory of the project.
- run `node compile.js`, then `node deploy.js`.
- run `yarn dev` to start up the server.
