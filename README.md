# Charity Hub

CharityHub is a DAO that ensures that charity donations actually get to their intended causes by a record of donations. As a donator, you can see the withdrawal history by the charity organizer, the purpose(s) of each withdrawal and who the money is sent to. It is built with **NextJS** and its smart contract written in **Solidity**. 

To get started:
- Pls ensure you have the **[MetaMask-extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en)** installed on your browser. After installation, set up one or two accounts on the **Rinkeby test network**.
- run `yarn install` in the root directory of the project.
- run `yarn dev` to start up the server.

Live link is [here](https://charity-hub.vercel.app/). Again, please ensure you connect using a Rinkeby test network wallet.
